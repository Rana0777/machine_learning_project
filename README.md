I developed an AI-based Fraud Detection System that predicts fraudulent transactions in real-time using XGBoost.
The system handles imbalanced datasets with SMOTE, provides risk scores and recommendations, and supports single and batch transaction analysis through a Gradio interface.
It achieves AUC-ROC above 0.95 and is designed for real-world deployment on financial transaction data.
